# Text Analysis And Classification

This repository showcases a project on text analysis and classification. The notebook applies advanced text processing and machine learning techniques to extract insights and classify textual data efficiently.

### Features
- Preprocessing textual data using modern techniques.
- Building classification models using scikit-learn.
- Incorporates data cleaning, feature engineering, and vectorization methods.
- Incorporate deep learning LLM concepts.
- Include bert-uncased from huggingface as the principal model for the task.
- Includes model evaluation techniques like accuracy, confusion matrix, and more.

### Results
- Achieved 50% accuracy score on the classification task.
- Presented visualizations to understand the data distribution and model performance.
- Demonstrated effective simple fine-tuning and performance enhanced fine-tuning (PEFT) of model.
