# Text Analysis And Classification

This repository showcases a project on text analysis and classification. The notebook applies advanced text processing and machine learning techniques to extract insights and classify textual data efficiently.

### Features
- Text Preprocessing: Modern techniques for cleaning and preparing textual data.
- Machine Learning Models: Classification models built using scikit-learn.
- Deep Learning: Utilizes concepts from large language models (LLMs).
- BERT Integration: Leverages bert-uncased from Hugging Face as the principal model for classification tasks.
- Feature Engineering: Data cleaning, vectorization, and feature extraction methods implemented.
- Fine-Tuning: Demonstrates effective simple fine-tuning and performance-enhanced fine-tuning (PEFT) of the BERT model.
- Evaluation Metrics: Includes accuracy, confusion matrix, and other performance metrics for model evaluation.
- Visualization: Data distribution and model performance visualized for better understanding and insights.

### Results
- Achieved 50% accuracy score on the classification task.
- Presented visualizations to understand the data distribution and model performance.
